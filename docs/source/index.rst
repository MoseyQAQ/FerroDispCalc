FerroDispCalc documentation
===========================

FerroDispCalc is a Python toolkit for pre- and post-processing of atomic simulations of ferroelectric materials, with special focus on analyzing ionic displacements and polarization calculations.

Features
---------

**Pre-processing**
- Build neighbor lists through intuitive APIs supporting various crystal systems (perovskites, HfO₂, In₂Se₃, etc.)
- Structure file format conversion (supports POSCAR, LAMMPS data, XYZ, etc.)

**Core Computation**
- *Python Interface*: Calculate ionic displacements, average structures, and perovskite polarization
- *C++ Interface*: High-performance processing of LAMMPS trajectory files for:
  - Average structure calculation
  - Ionic displacement
  - Local polarization (perovskite-specific)
  - Local lattice distortion
- *LAMMPS Plugin*: Real-time computation during MD simulations via ``compute`` commands:
  - On-the-fly displacement monitoring
  - Instant polarization access

**Post-processing**
- Automated visualization of vector fields (displacement/polarization)
